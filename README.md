# Wireless Mesh Network Graph Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for creating a synthetic graph representation of a  wireless mesh network. The graph generated simulates realistic scenarios based on various node and edge features. The aim of this project is to analyze and predict links within such a network using machine learning, specifically graph neural networks.

Objective: To predict potential links within this network based on the aforementioned features using graph neural networks. This can aid in optimizing network configurations, predicting potential network failures, or scaling the network efficiently.

## Requirements

To install the required dependencies for this project, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
